# Magisk Module to fix NFC reader in custom ROMs in Motorola

## Description

Finally, a Magisk module which fixes our beloved NFC reader for the argentinian app, SUBE. Not only fixes the principal app "SUBE", but also the app called "Carga SUBE". Once you install this module, the apps start to appear in Google Play Store :D
Only tested in xpeng, I assume it also works for other Motorola as I seen in a forum.

@uotlaf I used their module for remapping the assistant key for Astro as a template. (Also have to thank you for your support in the Astro community)
